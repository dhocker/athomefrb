/*
  Design Point on How React Router Works
  --------------------------------------
  Every level must pass a URL or it will be filtered out.
  Technically, we could route EVERY URL in the app at this
  point. That may or may not make sense.

  For example, /newdevice could be handled here or in HomePage.
  Since it is a function available on HomePage via DevicesTable
  it might seem to make more sense if it were handled by
  HomePage. And, that's how we've handled it here.
