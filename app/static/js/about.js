        <p className="card-text">
          This is the newest iteration of AtHome Control (AtHomeFRB) developed using
          Python 3, Flask, React, Booststrap and Webpack. Essentially, AtHome Control is
          a web app front end (a client) for the AtHomePowerlineServer.
        </p>
        <p className="card-text">
          AtHomePowerlineServer supports two different types of device modules:

            href="https://www.smarthome.com/sc-what-is-x10-home-automation"
          >
            &nbsp;X10&nbsp;
          </a>
          and
          <a
            className="card-link-x"
            href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/kasa-smart/kasa.html"
          >
            TPLink/Kasa
          </a>.
          X10 devices require an X10 power line controller to
          drive them, while TPLink/Kasa devices are WiFi based and do not require
          any controller. If you are just starting with home control, the TPLink/Kasa
          devices are probably the best choice. X10 is quite old and device
          modules get harder to find and more expensive as time passes.
