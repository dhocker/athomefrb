          <p className="card-text">
            This is the newest iteration of AtHome Control (AtHomeFRB) developed using
            Python 3, Flask, React, Booststrap and Webpack. Essentially, AtHome Control is
            a web app front end (a client) for the AtHomePowerlineServer.
          </p>
          <p className="card-text">
            AtHomePowerlineServer supports three different types of device modules:

            >
              X10
            </a>
            ,
            <a
              className="card-link-x"
              href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/kasa-smart/kasa.html"
            >
              TPLink/Kasa
            </a>
            &nbsp;and
            <a
              className="card-link-x"
              href="https://www.meross.com/"
            >
              Meross
            </a>
            .
            X10 devices require an X10 power line controller to
            drive them. Also, a two-phase bridge is usually required to
            propagate X10 signals onto both sides of typical home wiring.
            TPLink/Kasa and Meross devices are WiFi based and do not require
            any controller. They do require a smart phone or tablet for setup.
            If you are just starting with home control, the TPLink/Kasa or Meross
            devices are probably the best choice. X10 is quite old and device
            modules get harder to find and become more expensive as time passes.
