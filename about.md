## Overview
AtHome Control is a web app front end to the 
[AtHomePowerline server (AHPS)](https://github.com/dhocker/athomepowerlineserver).

Originally, AHPS
supported X10 devices. Over time support was added for Meross devices (smartplugs and bulbs)
and TPLink/Kasa devices (smartplugs and bulbs). Meross devices are problematic in that they require
a cloud connection and it is unclear where the connection actually goes. TPLink/Kasa devices 
only require a local network and do not go into the cloud. As a result TPLink/Kasa devices
are recommended.
